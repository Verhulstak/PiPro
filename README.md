# PiPro
~~The hackable action camera based on the raspberry pi CM4 and uses a custom carrier board and uses the pi camera module 3~~  
~~This whole thing is still very work in progress but im almost done~~  
Ok sooo this project became a nice example of the sunk cost fallacy when i realised you can get a gopro hero 10 on ebay for like 150-200 bucks all day and be able to get 4k 120 insted of the cm3's 1080p 50fps and i wont need to spend another 100+ hours on this  

if you want this name or something for ur repo then dm me on ig @Frhulst
